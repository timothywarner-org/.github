# Organization-wide GitHub Configuration

This repository contains organization-wide community health files and workflow templates that can be used by any repository within our organization.

## Using Workflow Templates

To use a workflow template in your repository, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Actions tab** of your repository.
2. Click the **New workflow** button.
3. You will see a list of workflows available to your repository. This list includes workflows defined in this `.github` repository under the **"Workflows shared within [Organization Name]"** section.
4. **Choose a workflow template** by clicking on it. You will be presented with the workflow file pre-populated in the GitHub editor.
5. **Customize the workflow** as needed for your repository. Each workflow template is a starting point and can be edited to fit your specific requirements.
6. **Commit the workflow** to your repository's `.github/workflows` directory. You can commit to the default branch directly, or create a new branch and use a pull request.

## Community Health Files

This repository also includes the following community health files that apply to all repositories within the organization:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: Our code of conduct guidelines.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: How to contribute to projects in our organization.
- `SECURITY.md`: Security policies and how to report security issues.
- `SUPPORT.md`: How to get support with projects in our organization.
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Issue templates for standardizing issue reporting.
- `FUNDING.yml`: Information on how to support projects financially.

These files are automatically used organization-wide unless a repository specifies its own version of these files.

For more details on creating or editing workflow templates and community health files, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en).
